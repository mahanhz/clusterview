**NOTE:** Need to install the [Job DSL](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin) plugin 

These are the "umbrella" jobs that need to be generated in Jenkins so that the Jenkinsfile's can be executed.

At the moment each of these groovy scripts need to be run manually in a Jenkins [seed job](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL)
